- Proposal interface for Hermes, High-frequency Emergency and Rural Multimedia Exchange System

- New interface should be a single page app, with angular.js framework as base, that will communicate with back-end php system

- First requisites: 
	- Separate regular users actions from admin users actions, so people don't shut down the system or delete stuff by accident.


Questions: 
	- Should users be able to cancel messages from others? do this will need also to have an admin password?
